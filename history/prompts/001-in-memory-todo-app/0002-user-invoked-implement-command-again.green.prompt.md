## Prompt

/sp.implement

## Response snapshot

The `implement` command typically signals the start of the implementation phase for a feature. To proceed, I need to understand what you would like to implement. Please provide a clear description of the task or feature you want to work on.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: PHR created for implement command.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: history/prompts/001-in-memory-todo-app/0002-user-invoked-implement-command-again.green.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will provide implementation task.
- 🧠 Reflection: PHR creation was successful.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None
