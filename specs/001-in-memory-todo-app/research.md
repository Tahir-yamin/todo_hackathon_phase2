# Research Findings: Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App

**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: [specs/001-in-memory-todo-app/spec.md](specs/001-in-memory-todo-app/spec.md)

## Summary

No complex research or architectural decisions requiring external investigation were identified for this project phase. The technical constraints (Python 3.13+, in-memory storage, CLI) are straightforward and well-understood.

## Decisions and Rationale

-   **Technology Stack**: Python 3.13+ was chosen as per project requirements. Standard library usage is sufficient for in-memory operations and CLI interactions.
-   **Storage**: In-memory data structures (lists/dictionaries) will be used as specified.
-   **Interface**: A simple command-line interface will be implemented using standard input/output.

## Alternatives Considered

No alternatives requiring extensive research were considered as the project scope and constraints are clear.
